         Disappearing Florida's goal is to show the connection between sprawling development and the loss of wild land in Florida. We envision a future for Florida
         where the need for housing does not preclude responsible stewardship of our wild spaces - a future where development practices have evolved
         to incorporate sustainable design into livable communities. We hope to draw attention to these issues, and direct energy and resources to organizations
         that are fighting the corrupt governments and greedy developers and are building a better future for Florida - for its residents both human and not.
