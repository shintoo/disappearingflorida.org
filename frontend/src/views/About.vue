        Disappearing Florida is a small initiative with a goal to bring awareness to irresponsible development
        practices — enabled by corrupt governments and carried out by unchecked corporations — and their impacts
        on our natural landscapes and wildlife. We hope to make clear the connection between habitat loss and
        massive-scale single-family-home development, and how with smarter planning, regulation, and incentives,
        we can build communities worth living in that don't destroy our natural world.
